How to set up the platform using VSCode 
(Ensure that you run all these commands in the same directory as server.js and database-initializer.js)

(If you haven't already, in VSCode use the following Node.js commands to install the necessary packages)
0.0 Install Node.js in VSCode
0.5 Npm install mongodb
    Npm install express
    Npm install pug

1. Npm install
2. Node database-initializer.js
3. Node server.js
4. Open localhost:3000

You must start on the home page(to initialize user and artist data). From here, the website will be locked from usage until you log in to an account registered on the platform. If the user does not have an account they may register a new account so long as the username is unique.
